tone () 


Description 

Produce a specific frequency on a pin square wave (50% duty cycle). The duration can be set, otherwise it would have been generated waveform until the call noTone () function. This pin can be connected to a piezoelectric buzzer or other speakers play the sound. 

Can produce a sound at the same time. If a pin has been playing music, that call tone () will not have any effect. If the music playing on the same pin, it will automatically adjust the frequency. 

Using the tone () function and PWM 11 feet with 3 feet of interference (except Mega board). 

Note: If you want to produce different tones on multiple pins, you have to use the tone before the next pin () function calls this pin noTone () function.
